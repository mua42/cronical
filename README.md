## What is cronical?

`cronical` monitors the cron jobs on your device(s) and converts them into an `.ics` calendar file that can be hosted and subscribed to in any calendar app (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.). Any changes to your cron jobs are automatically synced and reflected in your calendar.

---

## Overview

```
crontab changes on your device
        ↓
cron-watcher.py detects the change (runs every minute by default)
        ↓
commits and pushes to your GitHub repo
        ↓
GitHub Actions generates a merged calendar.ics from all devices (if use_github_actions = true)
OR generate-ics.py runs locally before pushing (if use_github_actions = false)
        ↓
calendar.ics is served publicly via your chosen hosting
        ↓
subscribe in Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, Outlook, etc.
```

### Key Features

- Supports multiple devices, all merged into one calendar
- Jobs that run multiple times a day appear as all-day events
- Jobs that run once a day or less appear as individual timed events
- Automatically syncs crontab changes
- Entirely free stack (GitHub, GitHub Actions, Cloudflare Pages or raw GitHub URL)
- Anyone can make a copy of this repo to their own account and have it working for their own devices
- Configurable via `config.toml` (no need to edit source files)

## Requirements

- `git` installed on your system
- Python 3.12+
- `uv` package manager ([install guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/))
- A GitHub account with a Personal Access Token (PAT)

### Python Libraries

Managed via `pyproject.toml`:

```
cron-descriptor>=2.0.8
croniter>=6.2.2
icalendar>=7.1.0
python-crontab>=3.3.0
python-dotenv>=1.2.2
```

---

## Configuration

cronical splits configuration into two files:

### `config.toml` (committed to repo, shared across all devices)

```toml
[watcher]
# interval in minutes that cron-watcher.py runs to check for cron changes
interval_minutes = 1
# exclude the cron-watcher.py command from the final calendar that is generated
# true = the final calendar does not include an event for cron-watcher.py
# false = the final calendar includes an event for the cron-watcher.py
exclude_self = false

[calendar]
# number of days ahead to generate calendar events for
# reduce this if the ICS file becomes too large or calendar apps are slow to sync
horizon_days = 365

[pipeline]
# true  = GitHub Actions generates the ICS after each push (recommended for multiple devices)
# false = generate-ics.py runs locally before pushing (recommended for single device)
use_github_actions = false
```

### `.env` (never committed, per-device secrets)

```
DEVICE_NAME=laptop
DEVICE_PATH=/full/path/to/cronical/crons/laptop.txt
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_USER=yourusername
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=cronical
```

Created automatically by `setup.py`. Never commit this file — it is already in `.gitignore`.

---

## Using Your Own GitHub Repository

Fork or clone this repo to your own GitHub account:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/original-owner/cronical.git
cd cronical

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/cronical.git

git push -u origin main
```

You can then clone and use your personal repository normally on any device.

---

## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone your repo and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cronical.git
cd cronical

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 3. (Optional) Edit config.toml to set your preferences before setup

# 4. Run the setup script
uv run setup.py
```

The setup script will prompt you for your device name and GitHub credentials, then handle everything else automatically. Here is what it does step by step:

1. Checks `git` is installed
2. Checks `.venv` exists (confirms `uv sync` was run)
3. Creates your device file in `crons/` (e.g. `crons/laptop.txt`)
4. Copies your current crontab into the device file
5. Creates and populates your `.env` file with your GitHub credentials
6. Adds `cron-watcher.py` to your system crontab (interval set by `config.toml`, default 1 minute)

All actions are logged to `logs/cronical.log`.

<details>
<summary>What setup.py does manually</summary>

If you want to understand what `setup.py` does under the hood or prefer to set things up yourself:

### 1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

### 2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

- Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Tokens (classic)
- Click **Generate new token (classic)**
- Give it a name (e.g. `cronical`)
- Select scopes: `repo` (full control of repositories) and `workflow`
- Copy the token immediately, GitHub will not show it again

### 3. Create your device cron file

```bash
# replace "laptop" with your device name
crontab -l > crons/laptop.txt
```

### 4. Create and fill in your `.env` file

```
DEVICE_NAME=laptop
DEVICE_PATH=/full/path/to/cronical/crons/laptop.txt
GITHUB_PAT=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GITHUB_USER=yourusername
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=cronical
```

### 5. Add the watcher to your crontab

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this line, replacing the path and interval with your actual values:

```
* * * * * /path/to/cronical/.venv/bin/python /path/to/cronical/cron-watcher.py # cronical-watcher
```

The first `*` matches `interval_minutes` in `config.toml`. Change both together if you want a different interval.

---


On the new device:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cronical.git
cd cronical
uv sync
uv run setup.py
```

The setup script will create a new device file in `crons/` and configure the watcher. All devices push to the same repo and GitHub Actions merges them into one calendar.

> [!NOTE]
> For multiple devices, set `use_github_actions = true` in `config.toml`. This ensures all device files are merged into one calendar by GitHub Actions rather than whichever device last pushed.

---

## Scripts

### `setup.py`

One-time setup script. Run this after cloning the repo on any new device. Reads `interval_minutes` from `config.toml` when adding the watcher to your crontab. Logs all actions to `logs/cronical.log`.

### `cron-watcher.py`

Runs as a cron job at the interval set in `config.toml` (default every minute). Logs changes and git operations to `logs/cronical.log`. It will:

- Check all required `.env` variables are set
- Read your current crontab
- Compare it to your device file in `crons/`
- If changed:
  - Pull remote changes
  - Update the device file
  - If `use_github_actions = false`: run `generate-ics.py` locally and include `[skip ci]` in the commit message to prevent GitHub Actions from also running
  - If `use_github_actions = true`: commit and push, letting GitHub Actions handle ICS generation
- If unchanged: print to terminal only, nothing written to log

### `generate-ics.py`

Runs in GitHub Actions on every push to `crons/**` (when `use_github_actions = true`) and on a quarterly schedule. Can also run locally (when `use_github_actions = false`). Reads `horizon_days` from `config.toml`. Logs progress to `logs/generate-ics-action.log`. It will:

- Read all device files from `crons/`
- For each job, determine if it runs multiple times per day:
  - If yes: one all-day event per active day
  - If no: one timed event per occurrence
- Save the merged `calendar.ics` to `public/`
- Log how many events were generated and where the file was saved

---

## GitHub Actions vs Local Generation

Controlled by `use_github_actions` in `config.toml`.

### `use_github_actions = true` (recommended for multiple devices)

```
crontab changes on your device
        ↓
cron-watcher.py detects the change
        ↓
pulls remote changes, updates device file
        ↓
commits and pushes to GitHub
        ↓
GitHub Actions generates calendar.ics from all device files
        ↓
calendar.ics is served from hosting
```

If using GitHub Actions. The workflow runs automatically on every push to `crons/**`, weekly on Sunday at midnight as a safety net,
and can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions UI (`Actions → Generate ICS → Run workflow`).

### `use_github_actions = false` (recommended for single device)

```
crontab changes on your device
        ↓
cron-watcher.py detects the change
        ↓
pulls remote changes, updates device file
        ↓
runs generate-ics.py locally to produce calendar.ics
        ↓
commits and pushes both files to GitHub with [skip ci] to skip Actions
        ↓
calendar.ics is served from the repo directly
```

This is useful if you only have one device, want faster updates without waiting for Actions, or want to keep the repo fully self-contained without any CI dependency.

## Logging

`cron-watcher.py` and `setup.py` log to `logs/cronical.log`. `generate-ics.py` logs to `logs/generate-ics-action.log`. The format for all three is:

```
[2026-05-16 10:32:01] [setup]: Git is installed
[2026-05-16 10:32:02] [setup]: Device file created
[2026-05-16 10:32:03] [cron-watcher]: Cron jobs have changed, syncing...
[2026-05-16 10:32:04] [cron-watcher]: Repo pushed
[2026-05-16 10:32:05] [generate-ics]: Calendar saved to public/calendar.ics
```

`logs/cronical*` is gitignored, covering the main log and all rotated backups (`cronical.log.1`, `cronical.log.2`, `cronical.log.3`). Log files rotate automatically at 1MB and up to 3 backups are kept.

`logs/generate-ics-action.log` is not gitignored and is committed to the repo by GitHub Actions after each run so you can inspect it without leaving GitHub.

To view local logs:
```bash
cat logs/cronical.log
# or follow live
tail -f logs/cronical.log
```

---

## Hosting

### Option 1: Public GitHub Repo + Raw URL (simplest, free)

If you are comfortable keeping your repo public (your crontab contents will be visible to anyone), use the raw GitHub URL directly:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/cronical/main/public/calendar.ics
```

### Option 2: Static Hosting Platform (private repo, public URL)

Keeps your repo private while serving the ICS file publicly. Cloudflare Pages works well for this:

1. Go to [pages.cloudflare.com](https://pages.cloudflare.com)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Set the build output directory to `public`
4. No build command needed
5. Your ICS will be available at `https://your-project.pages.dev/calendar.ics`

You can also set a custom domain in Cloudflare Pages settings for free.

> [!NOTE]
> When using Cloudflare Pages with `use_github_actions = true`, the calendar will deploy twice on each cron change: once immediately when you push the device file, and again after GitHub Actions regenerates `calendar.ics`. The second deploy is the one that reflects the updated calendar. This is expected behaviour.

---

## How to Subscribe

Once you have your URL from either hosting option above:

### Google Calendar

1. Go to [calendar.google.com](https://calendar.google.com)
2. Click `+` next to **Other calendars**
3. Select **From URL**
4. Paste your URL and click **Add calendar**

### Apple Calendar

1. Open Calendar → File → New Calendar Subscription
2. Paste your URL and click Subscribe

### Outlook

1. Open Outlook → Add calendar → From internet
2. Paste your URL and click Import

---

## Resetting a Device

If you need to re-run setup on an existing device:

1. Delete your device file: `rm crons/devicename.txt`
2. Delete your `.env`: `rm .env`
3. Remove the watcher from crontab: `crontab -e` and delete the `# cronical-watcher` line
4. Run `uv run setup.py` again

---

## Limitations

- **Linux and macOS only.** Windows is not supported since it does not have a native cron daemon.
- **User crontab only.** System-wide crontabs in `/etc/cron.d/` or `/etc/crontab` are not monitored. Only the current user's crontab (`crontab -l`) is tracked.
- **Special cron syntax may not parse correctly.** Expressions like `@reboot` or non-standard syntax may be skipped or display incorrect human-readable descriptions.
- **Calendar events expire after the configured horizon.** The ICS regenerates on every crontab change and quarterly via the scheduled workflow, but if neither happens for longer than `horizon_days` events will run out. Adjust `horizon_days` in `config.toml` if needed.
- **Google Calendar syncs slowly.** Google Calendar only refreshes subscribed calendars every 12-24 hours. Changes will not appear instantly.
- **Machine must be on.** If your machine is off or sleeping, the watcher cannot detect changes. Changes will sync the next time the machine is on and the watcher runs.
- **PAT expiry.** GitHub PATs can expire. If push/pull stops working, regenerate your PAT and update your `.env`.
- **Multi-device timezone differences.** If you use cronical across devices in different timezones, calendar event times will reflect the timezone of whichever device last pushed. For personal single-timezone use this is not an issue.
